## Important Notes

- **Rate Limits**: Reddit has rate limits. The tool includes automatic delays to comply with Reddit's rules.
- **Subreddit Rules**: Always follow the rules of the subreddits you're posting to.
- **API Limits**: Be mindful of Reddit's API usage limits.
- **Security**: Keep your `reddit_config.json` file secure and never share it publicly.
- **Privacy**: This tool is completely generic and doesn't store or track any of your Reddit activity or content.
- **Generic Use**: The tool can be used for any topic or subreddit - it's not limited to any specific use case.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Error loading configuration"**: Make sure your `reddit_config.json` file exists and has valid credentials.

2. **"Invalid credentials"**: Double-check your client ID, client secret, username, and password.

3. **"Forbidden" errors**: You might not have permission to post to that subreddit, or the subreddit might have posting restrictions.

4. **"Rate limit exceeded"**: Wait a few minutes before trying again.
